## What is SUMMATOR?

**SUMMATOR** is a professional tool for designing antenna combiners and phased systems angles. Engineers, hobbyists and communication technicians use it to plan antenna arrays, calculate cable lengths, phase shifts, tune settings and visualize radiation patterns. Suited for MIMO systems, repeaters, Wi-Fi sectors, satellite links and industrial communication systems.

## Key Features

- 📐 Phase shift and cable length calculation for 2-16 antennas.  
- 🧮 Coax cable selection with VF, loss and frequency considerations.  
- 📊 Gain and radiation pattern visualizer—before and after scenarios.  
- 🗺 Support for frequency range 30 MHz to 6 GHz.  
- 🔄 Profile export/import, backup and restore of settings.  
- 🧩 Support for Yagi, LPDA and sector antennas.  
- 🧠 Array diagnosis: side lobes analysis, interference detection.

## Advanced Functions

- 🌐 Simulation of arrays from 2 to 16 elements including phasing.  
- 🧲 SWR matching and coax optimization.  
- 🛠 Platform specific templates (planes, copters, gliders).  
- 🔍 Graphical “before/after” comparison and report generation.  
- 🎛 Custom profiles per platform: aircraft, copter, glider.  
- 🔧 Signal splitting, AUX channel configurations, hybrid arrays.
